# Introduction

## The Project
Having friends is very important. Many people have difficulty making friends and integrating into society, because of work or because they are shy. That's what this app solves, connecting you with people who also want to make friends like you.

## The Context
This project is my Portfolio Project, concluding my Foundations Year at Holberton School and ALX. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.

## Blog posts
After the development phase, we each wrote a blog post to reflect on the Tomodachi journey.

## Vue.js
For this project, i decided to focus on learning a new front-end framework. Following the advice of mentors and professionals, we chose to learn and use Vue.js. Then the whole frontend is based on vuejs.

## Flask
I decided to create the backend routes with flask because that's what we saw at cold, I wanted to deepen.

## Storage

### Cloud Firestore
The obvious choice for storing users' photos. It provides straightforward implementation for users to upload their photo and a relatively quick way to call and display these images for users to sift through.
